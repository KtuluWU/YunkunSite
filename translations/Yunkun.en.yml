    quote: 
        quote1: There is one spectacle grander than the sea, that is the sky; There is one spectacle grander than the sky, that is the interior of the soul.
        quote2: "The mind of man has three keys which open everything: the number, the letter, the note. Know, think, dream. Everything is here."
        quote3: To commit the least possible sin is the law for man. To live without sin is the dream of an angel. Everything terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a gravitation.

    title2: Design
    text1: The logo of this site is designed by Yun and Kun. Using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
    text2: "The concept of the logo is around the initial letters of our first names Yun and Kun, as we live in Paris in France, so we use the French brand Eiffel Tower as a theme by lettre Y of Yun and K of Kun. At the same time, we use the Chinese brush effect to join the element of our nationality: Chinese."
    text3: Create SVG vector graphics, including text, using the Adobe Illustrator tool. The design idea of the logo contains not only the initial letters of our first names, but also our full names in Chinese and pinyin. In order to avoid the invasion of the right of the font, all the texts are drawn manually.
    text4: "Then, using the blue and red colors of the French flag, with the fuzzy effect to embellish :"
    text5: "Get the final logo via Photoshop :"
